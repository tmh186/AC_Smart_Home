# Smart Home IoT#

## Objective:## Created a virtual smart home for a family of four (i.e. mom,
dad, 2 kids). There were two parts of this project: 1) Sensor Data (i.e.
Data Randomization) and 2) User Interaction. Project requirements included:

1. House Details
•	2 adults, 2 kids
•	3 Bed (overhead light, two lamps, 1 TV in master bedroom)
•	2 Bath (overhead light, exhaust fan)
•	2 car attached garage (two garage doors)
•	Clothes washer and dryer
•	3 exterior doors (front, back, house into garage)
•	Living room (overhead light, two lamps, TV)
•	Kitchen (overhead light, stove, oven, microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher)
IoT Sensor Data Sources:
•	Camera (Optional)
•	Door sensor (exterior doors and garage doors)
•	Window sensors
•	Motion sensor (Optional)
•	Beacon tags (pets, keys, purse, etc.) (Optional)
•	Water flow (kitchen, bathrooms (sink/shower), outside faucet)
•	Lights on/off
•	HVAC (external temp, internal temp, thermostat high/low settings)
o	External temp history and real time readings from online source

2. Formulas and Constants
Defined the mathematical implementation of the formulas using the following info: 
•	HVAC Operation - +/- 1 deg F per minute of operation
•	HVAC will maintain the set temp within 2 degrees (i.e. if the inside temp goes beyond 2 degrees of the set temp, then it will start operation to bring the temp back to the set temp).
•	Interior Temp Change
o	House Closed – For every 10 deg F difference in external temp, interior tem will +/- 2 deg F per hour 
o	Open Door – For every 10 deg F difference in external temp, interior tem will +/- 2 deg F per 5 min door is open
o	Open Window - For every 10 deg F difference in external temp, interior tem will +/- 1 deg F per 5 min window is open
•	Door Opening
o	Exterior door is open 30 seconds each time a person enters or leaves the house
o	M – F : 16 exit/enter events per day
o	S – S : 32 exit/enter events per day
•	Electricity Cost - $0.12 per kWh ( 1w = 1/1000 kw)
•	Water Cost – 
o	$2.52 per 100 Cubic Feet of water
o	1 Cubic Feet of water is 7.48 Gallons
o	100 Cubic Feet is 748 Gallons
o	So 748 Gallons costs $2.52
•	All Light Bulbs are 60w
•	Bath exhaust fan – 30w
•	HVAC – 3500w
•	Refrigerator – 150w
•	Microwave 
o	1100w
o	M – F : 20 min/day
o	S – S : 30 min/day
•	Hot Water Heater
o	4500w
o	4 minutes to heat 1 gallon of water
•	Stove
o	3500 watts
o	M – F : 15 min/day
o	S – S : 30 min/day
•	Oven
o	4000 watts
o	M – F : 45 min/day
o	S – S : 60 min/day
•	TV 
o	Living Room TV
	636 watts
	M – F : 4 hrs/day
	S – S : 8 hrs/day
o	Bedroom TV
	100 watts
	M – F : 2 hrs/day
	S – S : 4 hrs/day
•	Baths
o	M – F : 2 showers and 2 baths per day
o	S – S : 3 showers and 3 baths per day
o	Shower – 25 gallons of water used (65% hot water, 35% cold water)
o	Bath – 30 gallons of water used (65% hot water, 35% cold water)
•	Dishwasher
o	1800 watts
o	6 gallons of hot water per load
o	Runs 45 min per load
o	4 loads of dishes per week
•	Clothes Washer
o	500 watts
o	20 gallons of water (85% hot water, 15% cold water) per load
o	Runs 30 min per load
o	4 loads of clothes per week
•	Clothes Dryer
o	3000 watts
o	Runs 30 min per load
o	4 loads of clothes per week
•	Adults wake at 5AM, go to bed at 10:30PM
•	Kids wake at 6AM, go to bed at 8:30PM
•	Adults leave for work at 7:30AM, return home at 5:30PM
•	Kids leave for school at 7:30AM, return home at 4PM

3. User Input/System Rsponse Requirements:
•	Menu selection
•	Sensor manipulation
o	Open and close doors
o	Turn lights and TV on/off
o	Set thermostat
o	Etc.
•	Optional - Natural language processing
